# OpenGrade

This is an open source gradebook software.

Keep track of your classes, students, and their assignments, with the reassurance of safety and security through the benefits of open source software.

This is a personal project that I am making in [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io), [MapDB](https://mapdb.org), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).\
Currently in development.
