# OpenGrade

This is an open source gradebook software.

This is a personal project that I am making in [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).\
Currently in development.

## How to run:

1. Install [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (recommended version: 17)

2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

3. Run `mvn clean javafx:run`
